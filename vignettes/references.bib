abstract = "Abstract This paper proposes a context-minimal range of alternative regression models that is used to generate a range of alternative estimates. A prior distribution is assumed with a zero mean but an ambiguous covariance matrix. The choice of the prior covariance matrix is facilitated by transformation to standardized variables which makes the prior expected R 2 equal to the sum of the prior variances. Three different ranges of the prior expected R 2 are used to define three different intervals of prior covariance matrices which are used to produce three different sets of s -values. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper compares and contrasts Bayesian variable-exclusion methods proposed by Eduardo Ley and coauthors with methods proposed by Raftery and Sala-i-Martin et al. and with the s-values proposed by myself. A distinction is drawn between estimation uncertainty which is the focus of Ley׳s research and model ambiguity which arises in Ley׳s work and is the focus of my own recent proposal. The discussion is organized around the prior covariance matrix, which needs to be diagonal to support all-subsets regressions. The basic question addressed here is: what aspects of the prior covariance matrix can be taken as known, what aspects can be estimated and what aspects require a sensitivity analysis because they are neither known nor estimable. When diagonality is in doubt, we are more-or-less forced into a model ambiguity sensitivity mode because the data are never rich enough credibly to estimate the full prior covariance matrix. When diagonality is assumed, the data evidence, though very limited, can help to estimate the diagonal elements, but this literature has not yet produced a compelling conventional treatment which will necessarily include both estimation uncertainty and model ambiguity as they relate both to the diagonal values and to the rest of the prior covariance matrix. But there has been a lot of progress. "
